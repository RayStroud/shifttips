			Finally updated the app with a lot of features that have been building up. If there are any troubles, please <a class="link" href="mailto:ray.stroud@gmail.com?subject=ShiftTips" target="_blank">Email the Administrator</a>. The <a class="link" href="http://raystroud.ca/shifttips-old">old version</a> is also online, if needed. The new features include:
			<ul class="unordered-list">
				<li>&bull; The summary page now has an option to view shift summaries grouped by length (in half-hours).</li>
				<li>&bull; The text-size option was added to the Filters bar. Read more in the "How to use the filters?" section on the <a class="link" href="#/about">About / Help / FAQ</a> page.</li>
				<li>&bull; The view settings on the <a class="link" href="#/account">Account</a> page are now collapsible for easier access on mobile devices. Users can save the current view settings, which can be reloaded on any device. Read more in the "How to use the view settings?" section on the <a class="link" href="#/about">About / Help / FAQ</a> page.</li>
				<li>&bull; The filters and view settings are stored differently behind-the-scenes. Hopefully this doesn't cause any problems.</li>
				<li>&bull; The login process has changed behind-the-scenes, which will likely cause the app to prompt for a re-login.</li>
			</ul>
