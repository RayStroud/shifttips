			Finally updated the app with a lot of features that have been building up. If there are any troubles, please let me know. New features include:
			<ul class="unordered-list">
				<li>&bull; The summary page now has an option to view shifts grouped by length in half-hours.</li>
				<li>&bull; The filters and view preferences are stored differently behind-the-scenes. Hopefully this doesn't cause any problems.</li>
			</ul>
