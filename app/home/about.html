				<p>
					Shift Tips is a web app developed by <a class="link" href="http://raystroud.ca">Ray Stroud</a>, a seasoned restaurant worker and a beginner web developer. It was made to keep track of restaurant job statistics, like hours, tips, sales, time spent waiting around for people to leave to be able to go home - the important stuff. It started as a spreadsheet, but it grew into an app in order to see weekly earnings and to figure out which days of the week were the best to work.

					After every shift, add whichever information is intended to be tracked (e.g. start/end times, tips, sales, covers, section, etc). It will immediately calculate some relevant information (e.g. hours worked, tip percentage, sales per hour, sales per cover, etc). As more shifts are entered, summaries can be viewed, like weekly and monthly statistics, or statistics by day of the week.

To view a shift that has already been added, visit the <a class="link" href="#/shifts">Shifts</a> page and click on the desired shift to visit the Shift Details page. On the Shift Details page, the information can be modified by pressing either the Edit ( <span class="fa fa-edit"></span> ) button or Delete ( <span class="fa fa-trash"></span> ) button. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On the Add Shift or Edit Shift pages, enter or adjust whichever information is intended to be tracked, and click the Save ( <span class="fa fa-upload"></span> ) button to submit the information. To disregard the new information, either navigate away from the page, or click the Cancel ( <span class="fa fa-times"></span> ) button on the Edit page to return to the Shift Details page. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Each shift requires a correctly formatted value in the Date field (YYYY-MM-DD). Every other field can be left blank, but each entered value must be formatted correctly. See "What do all the fields mean?" to determine how to correctly format each field.
